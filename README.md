I am trying to understand how Exoplanets are detected using different methods.

Their are mainly 5 methods to detect Exoplanets:

- Radial Velocity: Orbiting planets cause stars to wobble in space, changing the color of the light astronomers observe.
- Transit: When a planet passes directly between its star and an observer, it dims the starâ€™s light by  a measureable amount.
- Direct Imaging: Astronomers can take pictures of exoplanets by removing the overwhelming glare of the stars they orbit.
- Gravitational Microlensing: Light from a distant star is bent and focused by gravity as a planet passes between the star and Earth.
- Astrometry: The orbit of a planet can cause a star to wobble around in space in relation to nearby stars in the sky.

I have used Transit method for now, but will add different methods in the future.
